(defn interpolate
"   Builds a function that interpolates given collection of points.
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_least_squares_(mathematics)

   Arguments:
     points -- collection of points. Each point is a collection [x y].
     type -- type of interpolation - :linear, :polynomial, :cubic, :cubic-hermite, :linear-least-squares. For most cases you should use :cubic or :cubic-hermite - they usually give best results. Check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation for brief explanation of each kind.

   Options:
     :boundaries - valid only for :cubic interpolation. Defines boundary condition for cubic spline. Possible values - :natural and :closed.
                   Support that our spline is function S. leftmost point is a, rightmost - b.
                   :natural - S''(a) = S''(b) = 0
                   :closed - S'(a) = S'(b), S''(a) = S''(b) . This type of boundary conditions may be useful if you want to get periodic or closed curve.
                   Default value is :natural

     :derivatives - valid only for :cubic-hermite. Defines first derivatives for spline. If not specified derivatives will be approximated from points.

   Options for linear least squares:
     :basis - type of basis functions. There are 2 built-in bases: chebushev polynomials and b-splines (:polynomial and :b-spline).
              You also can supply your own basis. It should be a function that takes x and returns collection [f1(x) f2(x) ... fn(x)].
              Example of custom basis of 2 functions (1 and  x*x): (interpolate :linear-least-squares :basis (fn [x] [1 (* x x)]))
              Default value is :chebyshev

     :n - number of functions in basis if you use built-in basis. Note that if n is greater that number of points then you might get singular matrix and exception.
          Default value is 4.

     :degree - degree of b-spline if you use :b-spline basis.
               Default value is 3.

   Examples:

   (def points [[0 0] [1 5] [2 0] [3 5]])
   (def linear (interpolate points :linear))
   (linear 0) => 0.0
   (linear 1) => 5.0

(defn interpolate-parametric
"   Builds a parametric function that interpolates given collection of points.
   Parametric function represents a curve that go through all points. By default domain is [0, 1].

   Arguments:
     points -- collection of points. Each point either a single value or collection of values.

                    :closed - S'(a) = S'(b), S''(a) = S''(b) . This type of boundary conditions may be useful if you want to get periodic or closed curv

                    Default value is :natural

     :derivatives - valid only for :cubic-hermite. Defines first derivatives for spline. If not specified derivatives will be approximated from points.

(defn interpolate-grid
  "Interpolates 2-dimensional grid. Returns function f that takes 2 arguments: x and y. By default function interpolates on [0,1]x[0,1].

   Arguments:
     grid -- collection of collection of numbers to be interpolated. If you need to interpolate vectors - interpolate each component by separate interpolator.
     type -- type of interpolation. Available: :bilinear, :polynomial, :bicubic, :bicubic-hermite, :b-surface, :linear-least-squares

   Common options:
     :x-range, :y-range - range of possible x and y.
                          By default :x-range = [0 1] and :y-range = [0 1]
                          :b-surface ignores this option and always uses [0, 1] x [0, 1]

     :xs, :ys - coordinates of grid points. Size of xs and ys must be consistent with grid size. If you have grid 4x3 then xs must have size 3 and ys - 4.
     Note that (:x-range, :y-range) and (:xs, :ys) both do same job - they specify coordinates of points in grid. So you should use only one of them or none at all.

   Type specific options:
     :boundaries - valid only for :cubic interpolation. Defines boundary condition for bicubic spline. Possible values - :natural and :closed. Default - :natural. Check documentation of 'interpolate' method for more explanation.

     :degree - valid only for :b-spline. Degree of a B-spline. Default 3. Degree will be reduced if there are too few points.

     :basis - defines basis for :linear-least-squares. It has 1 predefined basis :polynomial. :polynomial basis contains functions: (1, x, y, x^2, xy, y^2, x^3, ...) You can specify how many functions basis contains by using :n option.
              You can also specify custom basis. Custom basis is a function that takes 2 arguments - x and y, and returns collection of values. Example: basis that contains only 2-degree polynomials: (fn [x y] [(* x x) (* x y) (* y y)])

     :n - defines how many functions polynomial contains. Example: 1 - basis is (1), 3 - basis is (1, x, y), 5 - basis is (1, x, y, x^2, x*y)

   Examples:

   (def grid [[0 1 0]
              [1 2 1]
              [0 1 0]])
   (def interpolator (interpolate-grid grid :bilinear))
